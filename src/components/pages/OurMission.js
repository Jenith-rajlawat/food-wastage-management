      <p>Our mission is to reduce food waste and fight hunger by connecting donors with non-profit organizations through our food waste management system. By providing an easy-to-use platform, we aim to make it simple for people to donate their excess food to those in need, helping to ensure that no one goes hungry. Together, we can make a difference and create a more sustainable future for all.</p>
